# An Introduction to the Regex Function Match HTML

## Summary

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and searching within text. The regex /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/ is specifically designed to match an HTML tag, ensuring it follows the correct syntax and structure.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

`^` (caret) asserts the start of the string. It ensures that the HTML tag must start at the beginning of the line.

### Quantifiers

`+` (plus) is a quantifier that matches the preceding element one or more times. In this case, it applies to [a-z] and ensures that the tag name consists of one or more lowercase letters.

### Grouping Constructs

`()` (parentheses) are used to create capturing groups. In this regex, the first capturing group ([a-z]+) captures the tag name (e.g., div, p, span).

### Bracket Expressions

`[^<]` is a negative bracket expression that matches any character except <. It ensures that there are no additional opening angle brackets inside the tag.

### Character Classes

`[a-z]` is a character class that matches any lowercase letter. It is used to define the valid characters for the tag name.

### The OR Operator

`|` (pipe) acts as the OR operator in regex. It separates two alternative patterns. In this case, it separates the pattern for a closing tag >(.*)<\/\1> from the pattern for a self-closing tag \s+\/>.

### Flags

There are no flags specified in this regex.

### Character Escapes

`\/` is an escape sequence that matches a forward slash character. It is used to match the closing tag </ in the pattern >(.*)<\/\1>.
